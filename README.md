# reviung_ish

Welcome! 

Reviung_ish is a child born from the original reviung. This keyboard features choc switches (Only compatible with choc switches), choc space and a number row. The default keymap is my 'base' layout which i try to use across all my boards, though still WIP. The keymap consists of combos and 1 layer. I like to have various ways to use my keboards which is why i combine combo use with normal use e.g. having enter as combo (C, V) and a regular enter key. This is what feels most ergonomic for me. But feel free to modify it to your liking!

You will find a short build guide on this repo, and if you want to have extra PCB or haven't got yours yet you can catch me on discord: https://discord.gg/aTsAaWN5tc.
