## Introduction
This version of reviung_ish features a 56 key keyboard with 7 keys in the bottom row where 2 of them can be 1.5 units and the middle 2 units. Holes have been made if one would create a case, though two of the holes are a bit off compared to the other holes on the other side.

<strong>One note is that the 2U key in the middle of the bottom row is a bit tight to insert the switch since i forgot to make the holes the correct size. But its not a problem, just a bit tight. You could prepare a switch before soldering by inserting the switch into the tight switch hole and take it off again. Then use that switch when the socket has been soldered.
